# EDS223-Final-Portfolio

This coding exercise is part of a broader research project, which investigates the resilience of Santa Barbara's (CA) kelp forests to temperature disturbances, as well as the influence of different drivers on kelp population recovery. Here, I will produce some maps to display the region of interest in my thesis, as well as visually explore some of the variables that I am interested in (SST and bathymetry depth) as physical drivers of the system.

## Repository Structure:

Below are the data products included in this repository:

- A background summary of this project.
- A map of the Santa Barbara Channel with the 55 selected PISCO sites (Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of the Coastal Ocean).
- A map of the study site incorporating bathymetry features of the Santa Barbara Channel.
- A map of the study sites with an added layer of monthly surface sea temperature (SST) extracted from the MODIS Aqua Satellite (1.47 km resolution).
